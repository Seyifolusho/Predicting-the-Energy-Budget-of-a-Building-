# Predicting-the-Energy-Budget-of-a-Building-


## Introduction

Energy management is critical in optimizing building operations, reducing costs, and ensuring sustainability. This project focuses on predicting the energy budget of a building for a month using historical energy consumption and weather data. The results provide actionable insights for cost estimation and energy optimization strategies.


## Problem Statement

Predicting the energy consumption and cost of a building for a future month involves challenges such as:
- Handling large, multi-dimensional datasets (e.g., weather and energy records).
- Selecting relevant features and understanding their correlations.
- Building accurate models to forecast energy consumption and costs.
  
This project addresses these challenges using a data-driven approach with particular focus on Python as the tool.

## Dataset Description

The project utilizes:

1) Weather Data: Historical weather data for 3 years.

2) Energy Consumption Records: Energy usage data for the same period.
3) Energy Cost Data: Costs associated with monthly energy usage.
   
#### Key Features

- Time Series Index: The data is time-indexed to facilitate temporal analysis.
- Independent Variables: Weather-related features and other metadata.
- Dependent Variable: Energy consumption (target for prediction).

## Methodology

1) **Data Preprocessing**

I Loaded the datasets and checked for missing values.
Ensured data consistency and time-index alignment.
Selected the dependent variable (e.g., energy usage) and relevant features.

2) **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   
I performed correlation analysis to identify key predictors.
Visualized trends and seasonal patterns in energy consumption.

3) **Model Selection and Training**
   
I selected machine learning models for energy consumption prediction.
Split data into training and testing sets to validate model performance, and tuned hyperparameters to improve accuracy.

4) **Model Evaluation**
evaluated model performance using metrics like RMSE and R^2.
Compared predictions with actual energy consumption data to ensure reliability.

## Insights

Key insights derived from the analysis include:

- Strong correlations between certain weather parameters and energy consumption.
- Seasonal variations significantly impacting energy demand.
- Identification of peak energy usage periods for better resource allocation.

Recommendations
Based on the insights:

1) **Energy Optimization**: Invest in systems to regulate peak-period consumption.

2) **Predictive Maintenance**: Schedule maintenance activities during low-demand periods.

3) **Cost Planning**: Utilize forecasted energy budgets for better financial planning.


## Conclusion

The project successfully demonstrates the use of historical data and machine learning to predict energy consumption and budgeting. This predictive capability empowers building managers to make informed decisions, optimize operations, and reduce costs.
